Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing

Machine learning has revolutionized how we process and understand text.
Modern NLP systems can perform tasks like translation, summarization,
and semantic search with remarkable accuracy.

Vector embeddings are a key component of these systems, allowing us to
represent text as numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.
This enables similarity search and clustering of documents.

Document indexing systems use these techniques to make large collections
of text searchable and retrievable based on semantic similarity rather
than just keyword matching.
