# Machine Learning Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML systems can identify patterns in data, make predictions, and adapt to new information.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples include:
- Classification: Predicting categories (spam detection, image recognition)
- Regression: Predicting continuous values (stock prices, temperature)

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples:
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points
- Dimensionality reduction: Simplifying complex data
- Anomaly detection: Identifying outliers

### Applications
Machine learning powers many modern technologies:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Medical Diagnosis

The field continues to evolve rapidly with advances in deep learning, neural networks, and large language models.
