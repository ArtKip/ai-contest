# Vector Embeddings Guide

Vector embeddings are dense numerical representations that capture the semantic meaning of text, images, or other data types. They transform discrete data into continuous vector spaces where similar items are positioned close together.

## How Embeddings Work

### Text Embeddings
Text embeddings convert words, sentences, or documents into vectors:
- **Word Embeddings**: Represent individual words (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- **Sentence Embeddings**: Capture meaning of entire sentences
- **Document Embeddings**: Represent full documents or paragraphs

### Mathematical Foundation
Embeddings use various techniques:
- **TF-IDF**: Term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting
- **Neural Networks**: Learn representations through training
- **Transformer Models**: Attention-based contextual embeddings

## Applications

### Semantic Search
Vector embeddings enable semantic search that understands meaning rather than just keywords:
- Find documents with similar concepts
- Handle synonyms and related terms
- Understand context and intent

### Similarity Calculation
Common similarity metrics include:
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between vectors
- **Euclidean Distance**: Straight-line distance in vector space
- **Dot Product**: Simple multiplication and sum

### Use Cases
- Search engines and information retrieval
- Recommendation systems
- Content clustering and classification
- Machine translation
- Question answering systems

Vector embeddings are fundamental to modern AI applications, enabling machines to understand and process human language effectively.
